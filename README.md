DanisenBot usage

In order to make the bot functional for yourself you need to create 2 things
- a bot.cfg file
- danisen.db file (an empty file named danisen.db)

For the cfg file format it should be following

////

[TOKENS]
token = DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE

////

where you replace "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" with your respective token in order to host the bot.

(I will potentially be adding functionality for daniel to run on other servers but this is TBD)
