This bot uses Pycord and not Discord.py to clarify (these packages have the same name but have slightly different functionality)
(https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/index.html)

(Note if you already have discord.py installed you will need to uninstall it in order for pycord to work)

# DanisenBot setup
In order to make the bot functional for yourself you need to add your bot token to the bot.cfg file

where you replace "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" with your respective token in order to host the bot.

(I will potentially be adding functionality for daniel to run on other servers but this is TBD)


# Running the bot

Enter the following command into your terminal

python bot.py
